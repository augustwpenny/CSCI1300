dear oden,

i had the wildest dream last night! i was dreaming that i was walking down the street and i saw a sign that said " giveaway ! guaranteed miracle ! promise promotion !" i was curious , so i went inside.

there was a man standing at a table with a big box of prizes. he said, " welcome to the miracle giveaway ! choose a prize from the box and you are guaranteed to win something amazing ."

i reached into the box and pulled out a golden ticket. the man said, " congratulations! you have won the grand prize: a million dollars ! are you satisfied ?"

i was so excited ! i could not believe it. i asked the man how i could claim my prize. he said, "a ll you have to do is sign this contract ."

i read the contract carefully. it said that i would receive my million dollars in the form of a trial . if i was not satisfied with the money , i could return it for a full refund.

i signed the contract and the man handed me a check for a million dollars. i was so happy! i couldn't believe that i would get paid .

i woke up this morning feeling so happy and optimistic . i know that it was just a dream, but it felt so real. i'm going to work hard today and make my dreams a reality .

what do you think my dream means ? do you think it's a sign that something good is going to happen to me ?

talk to you soon,
[your name]
